```The source code found in src folder and all its subfolders is compiled and linked in the userâ€™s sketch. Only the src folder is added to the include search path (both when compiling the sketch and the library). When the user imports a library into their sketch (from the Arduino IDE's "Sketch > Include Library" menu or the Arduino Web Editor's "Include" button), the default behavior (configurable via the library.properties includes field) is for an #include statement to be added for all header (.h) files in the src/ directory (but not its subfolders). As a result, these header files form something of a de facto interface to your library; in general, the only header files in the root src/ folder should be those that you want to expose to the user's sketch and plan to maintain compatibility with in future versions of the library. Place internal header files in a subfolder of the src/ folder.```
